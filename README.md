Reversible Optical Memory Cell Using Bistable Liquid Crystals
Ozan Mustafa Tomta, 20.06.2025

Abstract
This document introduces the conceptual design of a novel optical memory unit. The system is based on bistable liquid crystal (LC) materials, which can be switched between two stable states using a short light or electrical impulse. Once set, the state remains stable without or with only minimal energy input.
The stored state can be read out optically in a non-destructive way, using reflection, polarization, or light transmission properties. The state can also be reversibly reset, allowing repeated use. This design enables a type of optical memory cell that does not currently exist in photonic or quantum computing: reversible, light-addressable, low-energy, and readout-capable.
Additionally, the theoretical maximum write and readout speed of such a system—if implemented using laser pulses—is limited only by the speed of light. As a result, the true potential of this technology is currently constrained by the limits of available switching and detection hardware. This indicates a significant area for future research and technological development.



Core Functional Idea
The system includes:
A bistable liquid crystal layer with two stable alignments (state A / state B),
Switching via light or electric impulse,
No continuous energy needed to hold the state (zero to very low energy),
Non-destructive optical readout, e.g. through polarization or color shift,
A reset mechanism using another controlled impulse.

Why this is new
Current quantum and photonic computing systems lack stable, reversible, and energy-efficient memory cells.
Liquid crystals are used for modulation, but not as memory structures with optical readout.
There is no known implementation of a reversible optical memory cell with these combined features.
Possible Applications
Optical RAM for photonic logic systems
Temporary storage for hybrid quantum architectures
Energy-efficient memory in AI optics or sensor systems
Reversible logic circuits based on light, not electricity
